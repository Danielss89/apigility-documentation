Deploying Apigility
===================

You've developed an API using Apigility, you've finished testing and documenting, and now you are
ready to push to production. How do you deploy the API?

Because Apigility applications are [Zend Framework 2](http://framework.zend.com/) applications, the
question of how to deploy Apigility becomes one of how to deploy a ZF2 application. Deploying a ZF2
application can be addressed in different ways depending on the specific use case and the deployment
methodology used in your environment.

Preparing to deploy
-------------------

A couple items to consider when preparing to deploy are (a) production configuration, and (b) the
landing page of your application.

Apigility builds on the Zend Framework 2 skeleton. This skeleton includes configuration for where to
find configuration files, as well as version control rules for excluding what is dubbed "local"
configuration. Essentially, ZF looks for application configuration files in the `config/autoload/`
tree, and has separate globs for those suffixed with `global.php` and those suffixed with
`local.php`; additionally, the latter, "local" files are omitted from version control by default.
_This makes them the recommended location for environment specific configuration, and particularly
any configuration involving credentials or specific servers._

We recommend keeping your production configuration separate from the application repository. This
can mean storing them in a separate, private repository -- for example, scripts that are uploaded
with tools such as [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/chef/), [Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com/), or
[Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/). Alternately, if you keep this information in another repository,
you can also use the ZFDeploy tool, outlined below, to slurp in the production configuration when
creating a deployment package.

Regarding the landing page of your application, if you use the Apigility skeleton application, the
"home page" by default redirects to the Apigility welcome page -- which is disabled when in
production mode! As such, we recommend altering your
`Application\Controller\IndexController::indexAction()` method to do something other than redirect,
or to redirect to another page. This will mean removing the following line:

```php
// in module/Application/src/Application/Controller/IndexController.php:
return $this->redirect()->toRoute('zf-apigility/welcome');
```

and replacing it with something else; for example, to have it redirect to your end-user HTML API
documentation:

```php
return $this->redirect()->toRoute('zf-apigility/documentation');
```

> ### Update the home page!
>
> The landing page for your application will **not** work, _and will in fact raise an error_ if you do
> not make the changes to the landing page as recommended above!

Manual deployment using Composer
--------------------------------

One way to deploy an Apigility application is to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to create a
production package. This method requires the following 3 steps:

### Composer: Step 1

Copy all the application files into a new directory, omitting the `vendor/` and `.git/` directories,
the `composer.lock` file, and all local configuration files: 

```console
$ rsync -a --exclude-from=".gitignore" --exclude=".git" /source /destination
```

Note the usage of the `--exclude-from` option to exclude all the files reported in `.gitignore`.
The `.gitignore` file specifies omitting the `vendor/` directory, the `composer.lock` file, and all
the local configuration files such as `config/development.config.php` and
`config/autoload/*.local.php` that should not be included in a production environment.

### Composer: Step 2

Execute the Composer installer in the destination folder, indicating that development dependencies
should be omitted. (If `composer.phar` is not included in the destination folder, you can download
it [from the Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar).)

```console
$ php composer.phar install --no-dev --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
```

The above command also indicates that distribution packages should be used if available (which will
reduce the overall size of your installation package), and to generate the production-optimized
autoloader.

### Composer: Step 3

After installing dependencies, you can package the entire application and deploy it. For instance,
you can create a ZIP file by executing the following command inside the package folder:

```console
$ zip -r /path/to/package.zip *
```

(Where `/path/to` is the path for the `package.zip` output file.)

At this point, you have a package you can deploy to production using your preferred deployment
mechanism.

### Notes on deployment

One of the most important parts in the previous steps is the usage of the `.gitignore` file to omit
development configuration files. When you deploy an Apigility application in production you must be
sure that the files are aligned with the production environment.

Here are some specific Apigility files that you must omit in production:

- `config/development.config.php`: If this file is present, Apigility will be executed in
  "development mode," enabling the Admin UI publicly via the `/apigility` URL.  You can switch off
  development mode in Apigility using the following command from the root of your project: 
  `php public/index.php development disable`.

- `config/autoload/*.local.php` files are releated to your local environment.  Usually these files
  are not under version control and are specific to the environment; you will likely need different
  settings for your production environment. (**Note**: As part of Step 2 above, you may want to
  create appropriate local configuration files for your production environment to include in the
  package.)

- `.git/` directories usually are not required in a production environment; left in place, these
  directories can significantly increase the size of the package.


ZFDeploy
--------

In order to simplify the deployment of APIs produced by Apigility, you can also use
[ZFDeploy](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-deploy), a command line tool for packaging ZF2
applications.

You should already have ZFDeploy installed in your Apigility application, under the `vendor/bin/`
folder. You can check if this tool is available executing the following command in the root
folder of your application:

```console
$ vendor/bin/zfdeploy.php
```

You should see the usage message of ZFDeploy as output.

This tool accomplishes all of the steps described in the previous section in one command. For
instance, if you want to create a ZIP package, you can execute the following command:

```console
$ vendor/bin/zfdeploy.php build /path/to/package.zip
```

(Where `/path/to/package.zip` is the path of the ZIP file to create.)

You can also use this tool to produce `.tar` or `.tgz` (`.tar.gz`) packages by specifying the format
extension that you want to use in the package output.

```console
$ vendor/bin/zfdeploy.php build /path/to/package.tgz
```

Moreover, ZFDeploy can also produce a `.zpk` package ready to be deployed using 
[Zend Server 6](http://www.zend.com/it/products/server/), the PHP Application Server platform provided by 
[Zend Technologies](http://www.zend.com).

```console
$ vendor/bin/zfdeploy.php build /path/to/package.zpk
```

Once you have created your `package.zpk` file, you can deploy it using the *Deploy Application*
feature of Zend Server. Below is a video demonstrating this feature.

[Visit the ZFDeploy tool documentation page](/modules/zf-deploy.md) for more detail on the packaging options available.

You can also deploy a ZPK from the commandline. To do this, download the [Zend Server Web API
SDK](https://github.com/zend-patterns/ZendServerSDK). Once you have it, you will
need to:

1. Create an API key in the Zend Server UI.
2. Create an SDK target.
3. Either deploy a new application, or update an existing one.

### Create an API key

To create an API key, first navigate to the "Administration" screen, and the "Web API" panel within
that screen:

![Zend Server Web API Screen](/asset/apigility-documentation/img/deployment-intro-zfdeploy-create-api-key.png)

Click the "Add Key" button, and follow the instructions. You will likely need to assign the key
administrator permissions in order to allow deployment.

Make a note of the key name and hash, as you wll use them in the next step.

### Create an SDK target

Now use the key name and hash to create an SDK target, using the SDK's `addTarget` command:

```console
$ zs-client.phar addTarget --target=<target name> --zskey=<key name> --zssecret=<hash>
```

The `<target name>` is a unique name you will provide so that the SDK can later use the
configuration you provide when accessing the Zend Server API. You may also need to provide the
`--zsurl` option if you are deploying to a server other than `http://localhost:10081`, and the
`--http` option in order to disable peer verification if your Zend Server deployment is over SSL.

```console
$ zs-client.phar addTarget --target=api --zskey=api --zssecret=<hash> --zsurl="https://foobar.tld:100082" --http="sslverify=0&sslverifypeer=0"
```

For more information on the `addTarget` command, run `zsclient.phar addTarget --help`.

Make a note of the target name, as you will use it in the next step

### Deploy or update an application

If you are deploying an API for the first time, you will use the `applicationDeploy` method of the
SDK:

```console
$ zs-client.phar applicationDeploy --appPackage=<package filename> --baseUrl=<url application will run under> --target <target>
```

where `<package filename>` is the ZPK you created with `ZFDeploy`, `--baseUrl` is the URI you want
to run your application under, and `target` is the SDk target you created in the previous step.

You will also need to provide either the `--createVhost` or `defaultServer`, depending on whether
you want a new vhost created for the application, or if you want to use the default server. Finally,
we recommend passing the `--userAppName <name>` flag, in order to provide a human readable name for
the application.

For more information on the `applicationDeploy` command, run `zs-client.phar applicationDeploy --help`.

If you are updating an existing application that you have already deployed, first use the
`applicationGetStatus` command in order to find the application identifier:

```console
$ zs-client.phar applicationGetStatus --target <target>
```

Look through the results to find the application and its identifier.

Next, use the `applicationUpate` command:

```console
$ zs-client.phar applicationUpdate --appId <id> --appPackage <package filename> --target <target>
```

where `<id>` is the application identifier you discovered with `applicationGetStatus`,  `<package filename>` is the package you created with `ZFDeploy`, and `<target>` is the SDk target you created in the previous step.

For more information on the `applicationUpdate` command, run `zf-client.phar applicationUpdate --help`.
